<h1>Our Security Engineering Values</h1>
<p>Following robust, repeatable application security practices allows engineers to create the most
cost-effective and appropriate security mitigations for your application. Efficient and effective security engineering
means appropriately tailoring your security needs to your application and following through on the correct process
throughout the product development lifecycle. Doing so creates defensible security: security that the designers can
show is appropriate for its application and the reasons why.

            <p>The best, most cost effective and lowest risk way to appropriately secure your application is to build
            security in from the start. Building security into the software, into the hardware, into the process. No
            process can function properly without good inputs. Building security in means buying in: committing to the
            process to ensure a quality output.

            <p>There are no right and wrong answers to most application security decisions. Each application is unique, and few
            applications have the benefit of a pre-existing application security standard. Following a sound, repeatable process
            to select the appropriate mitigations against cyber security risks is the key to defensible
            security: security that the designers can show is appropriate for its application and why.

            <p>Application security is the process of defining what exactly is "secure" and "insecure" for the application,
            systematically creating the plan to meet those goals and managing the changes therein, all within the product's final
            goals, requirements and constraints, namely cost. Cost effective security is diligent security. Get the
            most bang for your buck by following a repeatable, systematic approach to application security.

            <p>New attacks are always being discovered, and computational power growth of new hardware
            always threatens established cryptographic expectations. Technical and operational mitigations that plan on change
            are essential today. In-field updates, particularly over-the-air software updates, are becoming
            ubiquitous for connected electronics, for example. Today more than ever, the only constant is change. Plan on it.

            <p>Contrary to the popular saying "you can't add security on later", security needs can and do change.
            Rather than an excuse to re-develop working systems, good security architecture must keep the big picture in mind.
            Legacy applications may be thoroughly user vetted, well tested or built on undocumented assumptions. A systematic
            approach to application security based on best-practices can shed
            light on the most risks and costs associated with securing existing applications early on.

            <p>Most security architecture design choices have no existing standard, solution or best practice as a guide.
            For those questions, a more general problem solving approach must be used, and good inputs are vital. For
            the remainder of the challenges, standards and best practices provide indispensable guidance.
            Whatever the problem, we stand taller on the shoulders of those who have tread before.
